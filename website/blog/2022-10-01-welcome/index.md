Hey y'all amazing users of Harness Community!

Now, it's easy to submit your blog/articles and it's just a PR away!

Simply create a PR by adding Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory in [harness-community.github.io](https://github.com/harness-community/harness-community.github.io) repository!

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images abd can be displayed like below:

![Harness Community](./harnesser.png)

Oh and the other cool thing is, you can directly embed Youtube videos to your blog post and users can watch it on the same page and of course on a new tab if they want to;)

<div className="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4sbENt4IeM"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
    allowfullscreen
>
</iframe>
</div>

The blog supports tags as well! so refer the list of available tags and add it to your blog post!

Stay tuned for more improvements as this site is still in development phase:)

Any contributions are welcome!
